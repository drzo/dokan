### Introduction
You should write the test cases for your code. This ensures code quality, proper implementation of business logic, and easy refactoring.

### Basic TDD Workflow

1. __Write a Test__: Define the desired functionality.
2. __Run the Test:__ Ensure it fails (functionality not yet implemented).
3. __Write Code:__ Implement the minimum code to pass the test.
4. __Run Tests:__ Verify all tests pass.
5. __Refactor:__ Improve code structure while ensuring tests pass.
6. __Repeat:__ Continue for each new feature
